# Acoustic Reef 🌊🎶  
**AI-powered stethoscope for the ocean**

---

## 📌 Mission
Acoustic Reef is an AI-powered platform that analyzes underwater soundscapes to assess coral reef health in real time. Healthy reefs are noisy with life, while degraded reefs fall silent — we use this sound signature as a vital sign.

---

## 🚩 Problem
Traditional reef monitoring requires divers and manual surveys, which are **slow, expensive, and not scalable**. This leaves conservationists without timely data to detect problems early.

---

## 💡 Our Solution
- **Upload Audio**: Anyone can upload short clips from an underwater microphone (hydrophone).  
- **AI Analysis**: A CNN model trained on reef soundscapes delivers instant health reports.  
- **Dashboard**: Simple web interface (Streamlit) with:
  - Health status (Healthy / Degraded)  
  - Confidence score  
  - Spectrogram visualization  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** (core language)  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (AI model)  
- **Librosa** (audio processing)  
- **Streamlit** (web dashboard)  
- **Google Colab** (model training with free GPU)  

---

## 📅 Competitions
- **AI for Climate Change Challenge** (Prototype deadline: Nov 15, 2025)  
- **Smart India Hackathon 2025** (Adapted for student innovation / environment problem statements)
